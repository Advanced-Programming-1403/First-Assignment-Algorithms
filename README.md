# First Assignment - Algorithms

Are you ready to challenge yourself with some algorithmic problems? These will help you get more confident with *Java* and remember the **Way of BP**.

## Getting Started

This is the second part of your first assignment in the "Advanced Programming" course. So we highly recommend you to finish the first part - [WarmUp](https://github.com/Advanced-Programming-1403/First-Assignment-WarmUp)

There are 3 problems you should solve right the same as the way you did in the previous part.

## Evaluation

You need to:

- Complete the functions as described in comments the way your code compile and run without any error
- Pass all unit tests in the ```src\test\java```
- Code clean and readable for your mentor. It's recommended to use comments and take a look at clean-code instructions

For your mentor to check the assignment, you should do the same steps mentioned in *WarmUp* and use git

## Notes

- It's strictly prohibited to use ChatGPT or any other generative model for any section of this assignment.
- Though, you can use them to learn concepts you're having trouble to learn with searching or asking.
- It's recommended to use *branches* in git, so you can commit your changes in "origin/develop" and then make a pull request for your mentor.

Good luck!
